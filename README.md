# Browser Brawl

**Train browser agents like GANs — by making them fight.**

One AI agent (the attacker) tries to complete a task on a real webpage. Another AI agent (the defender) tries to block it with JavaScript injections. They compete in real time inside a cloud browser. Every match produces rich, structured training data — tool calls, DOM snapshots, screenshots, full conversation traces — that you can use to fine-tune smaller browser models.

We built this during YC's 24 hour browser use hackathon - during that we validated the training pipeline by converting Browser Brawl traces into fine-tuning data which was used to run supervised fine tuning on Qwen2.5-3B.

## The Idea: Adversarial Data Generation for Browser Agents

Browser agent training data is expensive. 
We took inspiration from **Generative Adversarial Networks**. In a GAN, a generator learns to produce realistic outputs by competing against a discriminator that tries to distinguish real from fake. The adversarial pressure forces both networks to improve — the generator produces increasingly realistic data, and the discriminator becomes a better judge.

Browser Brawl applies this intuition to browser agents:

| GAN | Browser Brawl |
|-----|---------------|
| **Generator** produces realistic data | **Attacker** navigates real websites, completes tasks |
| **Discriminator** tries to catch fakes | **Defender** disrupts the page with JS injections |
| Adversarial pressure improves both | Harder disruptions force richer, more resilient trajectories |
| Training signal from the competition | Training data from every match — win or lose |

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Lobby
    L1[Pick task]
    L2[Pick difficulty]
    L3[Pick framework]
    L4[Start match]
  end

  subgraph Arena
    A1[Attacker<br/>Playwright MCP / Browser-Use / Stagehand]
    A2[Cloud browser live view]
    A3[Defender<br/>Haiku + CDP injection]
    A1 --> A2
    A3 --> A2
    A2 -. SSE stream .-> C1
  end

  subgraph TrainingPipeline["Training Pipeline"]
    C1[Convex DB<br/>conversations, steps/screenshots,<br/>disruptions/DOM, health timeline]
    C2[extract -> convert -> ShareGPT JSONL]
    C1 --> C2
  end

  L4 --> A1
```

1. **Lobby**
   - Choose a browser agent and a real web task for it to accomplish (Amazon shopping cart, Google Flights, Hacker News), as well as a defender agent difficulty

2. **Arena**  
   - Attacker navigates the website using Playwright tools  
   - Defender injects disruptive JavaScript into the page

3. **Game Over**  
   - Attacker wins by completing the task  
   - Defender wins by draining the attacker's health

4. **Data Collection**  
   Each match records:
   - tool calls
   - DOM snapshots
   - screenshots
   - full agent conversations
   - View and replay full game traces at [browser-brawl.com/history](https://browser-brawl.com/history)

This data becomes training trajectories for browser agents.

### One-Click SFT Pipeline

We built a PoC fine tuning pipeline that uses Browser Brawl's traces.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  H["/history - select traces"] --> S["Next.js API Route - Anthropic tool_use to ShareGPT to OpenAI Messages"] --> FS["Convex - upload JSONL"] --> K["Modal - fire-and-forget POST"] --> TR["Unsloth QLoRA on A10G"] --> MG["LoRA merge into base model"] --> SV["vLLM serve endpoint"]
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| **LLM** | Anthropic SDK — Claude Sonnet 4.6 (customizable), Claude Haiku 4.5 (defender) |
| **Cloud Browsers** | Browser-Use API (managed sessions with CDP + live view) |
| **Database & Storage** | [Convex](https://convex.dev) (real-time DB + file storage) |
| **LLM Observability** | [Laminar](https://www.lmnr.ai) (auto-traces all Anthropic calls) |
| **Fine-tuning** | Unsloth QLoRA on Modal A10G — Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct |
| **Serving** | vLLM on Modal, OpenAI-compatible API |

### Supported Browser Agent Frameworks

The attacker agent is framework-agnostic — pick the one you prefer:

| Framework | How it works |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Playwright MCP**](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp) | Spawns a Playwright MCP server connected to the cloud browser via CDP. Full tool suite (click, type, navigate, snapshot, etc.) |
| [**Browser-Use SDK**](https://browser-use.com) | Uses Browser-Use's built-in agent API for browser control |
| [**Stagehand**](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) | Browserbase's AI-native browser automation framework |
| [**Fine-tuned Qwen**](scripts/modal_train_pipeline.py) | Your own Qwen2.5-3B fine-tuned on Browser Brawl traces, served via vLLM. Enable via the BYOM toggle in the lobby. |

## Roadmap

- **Bring Your Own Model** - fight with your fine-tuned model directly in the arena
- **Supervised fine-tune Qwen 3.5** (mid-sized) on adversarial and non-adversarial browser traces
- **New game modes:**
  - Race mode - multiple browser agents racing to complete the same task
  - Tower defense mode - defender places all perturbations upfront with a budget, attacker has a time limit
